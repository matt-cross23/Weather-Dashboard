# Weather-Dashboard
This project demanded many thought exercises that improved my knowledge on coding, in particular incorporating server-side APIs' data into functional code and blending the data retrieved with original code to make a website have more functionality. There were aspect that I could not figure out but the exercise allowed me to further conceptualize local storage data and better my CSS skills.
